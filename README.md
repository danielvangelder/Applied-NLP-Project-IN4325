## Getting Started

### Dataset and Baseline Model
The dataset for the FNC-1 challenge can be retrieved from the [dataset repository](https://github.com/FakeNewsChallenge/fnc-1). Place all dataset files in the `/data/fnc-1/` directory. Download the baseline from the [baseline repository](https://github.com/FakeNewsChallenge/fnc-1-baseline) and run the baseline model on the dataset. The code needs to be adapted so that it can output the results as a stance file. Add the following lines of code to the `fnc_kfold.py` file at line XX:

```python
pass
```
